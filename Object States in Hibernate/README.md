## Object States in Hibernate

In Hibernate, an object can exist in any of the following states:

- Transient: An object is in the transient state if it is not associated with any Hibernate session. The object is not in the persistent state, and any changes made to it are not tracked by Hibernate. Once the session ends, the object is lost.

- Persistent: An object is in the persistent state if it is associated with a Hibernate session. The session tracks any changes made to the object, and these changes are automatically synchronized with the database when the transaction is committed.

- Detached: An object is in the detached state if it was previously associated with a Hibernate session but is no longer in that state. The object is no longer tracked by the session, and any changes made to it will not be synchronized with the database.

- Removed: An object is in the removed state if it has been deleted from the database by calling the session.delete() method. Once an object is removed, it cannot be used again in the current session.

These states are important to understand when working with Hibernate, as they affect how the application interacts with the database and how changes made to objects are persisted.
