## Hibernate Query Language(HQL)

HQL stands for Hibernate Query Language, which is an object-oriented query language used to retrieve data from a relational database and manipulate the data as objects. It is similar to SQL (Structured Query Language), but instead of working with tables and columns, HQL works with classes and objects.

HQL is a powerful feature of Hibernate that allows developers to write database queries in a more object-oriented way, and provides a level of abstraction over the database schema. It supports a wide range of queries, including SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE, and INSERT, and allows developers to perform complex operations on objects in a way that is easy to understand and maintain.

HQL is also designed to work seamlessly with Hibernate's caching and transaction management features, which can help improve application performance and ensure data integrity. Overall, HQL is a key feature of Hibernate that makes it a popular choice for building robust, scalable, and maintainable database applications.

## Steps to perform HQL

The general steps to perform HQL in Hibernate:

- Create a Hibernate SessionFactory object and configure it to connect to your database.
- Create a Hibernate Session object from the SessionFactory.
- Begin a transaction using the Session object.
- Create an HQL query using the createQuery() method of the Session object. The HQL query should be written using the syntax of the Hibernate Query Language.
- Bind any query parameters using the setParameter() or setParameters() method of the Query object.
- Execute the query using the list() method of the Query object to get the list of results, or the uniqueResult() method to get a single result.
- Commit or roll back the transaction depending on the outcome of the query execution.
- Close the Session object.

These are the basic steps, but the specifics may vary depending on the exact use case and requirements.

## Parameters Binding In HQL

Parameter binding is a mechanism in HQL that allows us to pass parameters to a query dynamically at runtime. We can use this mechanism to write dynamic queries where the parameter values are not known at the time of query writing.

Here are the steps to perform parameter binding in HQL:

- Create an HQL query with placeholders for the parameters. The placeholders are represented by a colon (:) followed by a parameter name. For example:

```
String hql = "from Employee e where e.department = :dept and e.salary > :minSalary";
```

- Compile the query using the `createQuery()` method of the `Session` object. This method returns an instance of `Query` interface.

```
Query query = session.createQuery(hql);
```

- Set the values of the parameters using the `setParameter()` method of the `Query` interface. This method takes two arguments - the parameter name and its value. For example:

```
query.setParameter("dept", "IT");
query.setParameter("minSalary", 50000);
```

- Execute the query using the `list()` or `uniqueResult()` method of the `Query` interface. The `list()` method returns a list of objects that match the query criteria, while the `uniqueResult()` method returns a single object.

```
List<Employee> employees = query.list();
```

That's it! By following these steps, you can perform parameter binding in HQL and retrieve the results based on the dynamic parameters.

## Few Query execution methods in HQL

In Hibernate, there are different ways to execute a query using HQL:

- list(): This method is used to retrieve a list of results from the database. It returns a list of objects, where each object represents a row from the result set.

- uniqueResult(): This method is used to retrieve a single result from the database. It returns an object, which represents a row from the result set.

- iterate(): This method is used to retrieve a list of results from the database one at a time. It returns an Iterator object, which can be used to retrieve each result one at a time.

- scroll(): This method is used to retrieve a large number of results from the database efficiently. It returns a ScrollableResults object, which can be used to retrieve the results one page at a time.

- executeUpdate(): This method is used to execute an update or delete query in the database. It returns an integer value, which represents the number of rows affected by the query.
