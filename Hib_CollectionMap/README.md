### Hibernate Collection Mapping 

The Hibernate ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) framework has a feature called "Hibernate collection mapping" that lets developers map collections of related objects to relational database tables.

In Hibernate, a collection can be a list, set, map, or array of related objects. Using one of the collection mapping strategies that are available, a collection can be mapped to a table, such as:

**List Mapping:** This methodology maps an assortment to a table with an unfamiliar key section in the table addressing the record of the component in the rundown.

**Mapping a Set:** A foreign key column in the table is used in this strategy to map a collection to the primary key of the owning entity.

**Mapping a Map:** A collection is mapped to a table with two columns, one for the key and one for the value, using this strategy.

**Mapping an Array:** A foreign key column in the table, which represents the index of an array's elements, is used in this strategy to map a collection to a table.

Using the appropriate annotations or XML mapping files, you must define the collection as a property of your entity class in order to use collection mapping in Hibernate. In the Hibernate configuration file, you must also set the collection mapping strategy and other properties.

In general, Hibernate's collection mapping is a powerful feature that makes developing database-driven applications simpler by making it simple for developers to map and persist collections of related objects to a relational database.
