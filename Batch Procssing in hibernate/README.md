## Batch Processing In Hibernate

Batch processing in Hibernate refers to a mechanism where multiple SQL statements are executed in a single database round trip. This mechanism improves the performance of an application by reducing the number of database round trips required to perform a set of database operations.

In Hibernate, batch processing can be achieved using the following two approaches:

- JDBC batching: In this approach, multiple SQL statements are sent to the database in a single network round trip using the JDBC batch API. Hibernate provides an option to enable JDBC batching by setting the hibernate.jdbc.batch_size property in the configuration file.

- Hibernate batching: In this approach, Hibernate internally batches multiple SQL statements into a single SQL statement and sends it to the database. Hibernate provides an option to enable Hibernate batching by setting the hibernate.jdbc.batch_versioned_data property in the configuration file.

Both approaches can significantly improve the performance of the application by reducing the number of database round trips required to perform a set of database operations. However, it is important to note that batch processing should only be used for a large number of SQL statements to be executed together, and not for individual SQL statements as it may lead to reduced performance.

## flush() and clear() methods in batch processing

In Hibernate, the `session.flush()` method is used to synchronize the changes made to the entities in the session with the database. It means that Hibernate will execute SQL statements to synchronize the in-memory state of the objects with the state in the database. Hibernate automatically flushes the session before committing the transaction, but in some cases, it may be necessary to flush the session explicitly.

On the other hand, the `session.clear()` method is used to remove all the objects from the session cache. It means that all the entities that are currently managed by the session will be detached and will no longer be tracked for changes. This can be useful to free up memory when you are dealing with a large number of objects, but you need to be careful when using it because any changes made to the detached objects will not be persisted to the database.

In summary, `session.flush()` synchronizes the changes made to the session with the database, while `session.clear()` removes all the entities from the session cache.
